How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It was less tedious than comparing each line

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Documentation is reallyimportant in case a previous version was better than the new one

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
One might forget to commit or commit too big or too small since it's all a judgement call and no fixed value the call might be taken at the wrong time and might not make logical sense

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Treating each file separetely has no relation to the other file and a whole file can be restored to the previous version without having to track each change. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows history of commits and git diff shows the line changes
